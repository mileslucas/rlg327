This program is designed to create a dungeon using ASCII characters for a terminal window based adventure game. The current code creates a border around the workable area of size 80x21 and creates rooms and paths. There will be exactly 6 rooms in each dungeon with at least one path between all rooms. There are no command line arguments for this program.
